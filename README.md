# Installing TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi 3 (and probably 2 as well)

## Installing from Pip

This is the easiest way to get TensorFlow onto your Raspberry Pi 3. Note that currently, the pre-built binary is targeted for Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian 8.0, so this may or may not work for you.

First, install the dependencies for TensorFlow:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev
```

## Building from Source

See the [step-by-step guide](). **Warning: it takes a while.**
